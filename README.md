# DeepLearningMNIST
Implements image classification functions such as forward pass, activation functions, performance calculators from scratch and compares with high level keras api


For this repository, the work has been  are divided into mutliple notebooks. Each repository performs an objective as outlined in the problem statement pdf.

# Here is a brief outline:

 1. Part 1_1 builds a softmax classifier and implements the following functions:
    1. forward_pass
    2. cross_entrophy
    3. calculate_accuracy
    
 2. Part 1_2_1 and Part 1_2_2 build two different architectures with ReLu

 3. Part 1_3 Adds L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization to the above architectures.

 4. Part B - Compares the Above (scratch implementation) with the high level Keras API using TensorFlow.


# The Analysis Report comprises of:
      1. A detailed comparision and commentary on the performance of all the architectures.
      2. A research article on Adam Optimizer (must read - very intresting!!)
